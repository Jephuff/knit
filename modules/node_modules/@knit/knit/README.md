# Knit

Knit CLI

## Commands

#### list

```
❯ knit list
Usage: ls [options] [modules...]

list modules and their dependencies

Options:

  -h, --help          output usage information
  -d, --dependencies  show dependencies
```

This command will list out your modules with their dependency count and show whether you have missing packages you need to install:

```
❯ knit list
✔ discovering modules
✔ reading package.json of modules

info showing dependencies for 4 modules

- @knit/needle (0.0.7) [1 dependencies]
- @knit/depcheck (0.0.7) [4 dependencies, 1 missing]
- @knit/knit-core (0.0.12) [6 dependencies]
- @knit/knit (0.0.12) [37 dependencies]
```

Passing `--dependencies` will expand the dependencies into a list to show you a more detailed view of your modules:

```
❯ knit list --dependencies
✔ discovering modules
✔ reading package.json of modules

info showing dependencies for 4 modules

- @knit/needle (0.0.7) [1 dependencies]
└─ read-pkg-up

- @knit/depcheck (0.0.7) [4 dependencies, 1 missing]
└─ lodash depcheck pify
missing:
└─ babylon

- @knit/knit-core (0.0.12) [6 dependencies]
└─ execa chalk fs-extra read-pkg @knit/needle @knit/depcheck

- @knit/knit (0.0.12) [37 dependencies]
└─ execa flow-bin eslint @knit/needle listr commander chalk @knit/knit-core ...
```

You can pass in module names to limit the scope of the search:

```
❯ knit list @knit/needle
✔ discovering modules
✔ reading package.json of modules

info showing dependencies for 1 module

- @knit/needle (0.0.7) [1 dependencies]
└─ read-pkg-up
```

#### list --updated

This command shows which modules have been updated since the last release. It considers modules that have updated dependencies to be updated themselves. For example if `moduleB` depends on `moduleA` modifying `moduleA` will cause this command to return:

```
❯ knit list --updated
✔ discovering modules
✔ reading package.json of modules
✔ getting last tag
✔ determining updated modules since last release

info found 2 updated modules

- moduleA (0.0.1)
- moduleB (0.0.1)
```


#### validate

```
❯ knit validate
```

This command is used to make sure the project configuration will work with `knit` and looks to make sure their are no missing or unused dependencies.

```
❯ knit validate
✔ looking for `node_modules` in .*ignore files
✔ discovering modules
✔ checking yarn is on PATH
✔ checking yarn version
✔ validating package.json
✔ check for missing dependencies
✔ check for unused dependencies
```
